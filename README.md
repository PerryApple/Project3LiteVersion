# Project3LiteVersion
This is the code of Project3 for CSCI6212. This is a lite version for Maze Using DFS. No visible graph will be displayed. only the running time of DFS path finding will be showed.
To change the inpute scale, please modify statement: “Maze maze = new Maze(1000,1000);”  
Maze maze = new Maze(i,j) will produce a maze which has i*j nodes.
Change i and j for different input scales.
The output of this program is every node the algorithm visited and the running time of DFS path finding. (in ns)
